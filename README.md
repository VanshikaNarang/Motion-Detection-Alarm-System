# Motion-Detection-Alarm-System
This project implements a motion detection alarm system using a webcam. The system captures video frames, processes them to detect motion, and triggers an audible alarm if significant motion is detected. The script uses OpenCV for video capture and image processing, and threading to handle the alarm sound.

#Features

Real-time video capture and processing

Motion detection using frame differencing

Audible alarm triggered on detecting significant motion

Toggleable alarm mode

Simple user interface to start/stop alarm mode and exit the application

#Requirements:

Python 3.x

OpenCV

Imutils

Winsound (Windows only)
